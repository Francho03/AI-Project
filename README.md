### Project Overview:
This project aims to explore airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on various factors.

### Methods Used:
1. **Decision Trees**: A supervised learning algorithm that helps us classify passengers into satisfied or dissatisfied groups.
2. **K-means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning method used to group passengers into segments based on their behaviors and preferences, helping us better understand their patterns.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Objectives:
- Develop a decision tree model that predicts passenger satisfaction.
- Apply K-means clustering to identify different passenger segments and understand their behavior.
- Analyze the results and draw actionable insights.
